            My name is Brooke Danyluk. My major is Information Management and Technology with a concentration in Security, coupled with a minor in Global Security Studies. I am interested in being a cyber analyst. A few of my skills include RStudio, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, Python, and SQL. Outside of school, I enjoy going to the gym, hanging out with friends, and shopping. My favorite show right now is the Summer I Turned Pretty. I also have three brothers and live in New York. As a senior, I am excited for this school year and interested in learning more about web development.
